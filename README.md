A list to rate and sort games that you play through the year.
#All the requirements were met the way i wanted the script to work as. It is an easy way to keep track of the games you played throught the year and be able to sort them.
#The only Library i had to install was importing OS.
#If I had time I would work on changing the interface instead of an option menu as i was suggested to do if I had time.
